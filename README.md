Project: Website Performance Analyzer

Introduction: SpeedX (a hypothetical/imaginary tool) is a web-based tool designed to analyse the performance of any given website and display key performance metrics.

Product Functionality: Users can input a website URL to initiate a performance analysis. The tool will then assess the target website's performance and present key metrics such as page load time, total request size, and number of requests.

Tasks: Develop a web application using React and Node.js to: Capture website performance data. Create a user-friendly interface to display performance metrics. Consider incorporating additional performance metrics for a comprehensive analysis.

Evaluation Criteria: Code quality, efficiency, and maintainability. Accuracy and completeness of performance data. User interface clarity and usability. Ability to identify and implement additional performance metrics.
